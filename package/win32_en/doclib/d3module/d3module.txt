 overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
d3module is a module that enables simple 3D drawing with only HSP standard instructions.
This is

The purpose of developing d3module is to "extend HSP standard drawing instructions to 3D".
By including d3m.hsp, HSP standard pset and
You can now use 3D drawing commands in a format similar to commands such as line and circle.
I will.

Same execution result in many environments because it does not depend on DirectX or 3D accelerator
Can be obtained.

d3module is a very poor 3D drawing system with no concept of light source or z sort.
However, sometimes the wire-based 3D space that feels a little nostalgic is also interesting.
it might be.

Areas for d3module:
・ Three-dimensional mathematical graph drawing
・ Visualization of 3D physics simulation, etc.

Areas where d3module is not suitable:
・ 3D games in general
・ Fields that require high-speed processing


 About the demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
d3m_techdemo.exe (d3module techdemo) is created only with standard HSP instructions
This is a demonstration program of d3module.

・ About the song

In this techdemo, we will use Vijore, a song released by onoken.
It has received.

onoken's site: http://www.axsword.com/

With d3module techdemo, a long period of time that goes far beyond your usual working style
I continued to write code over the years, but it was this that kept me motivated during that time
Thanks to the wonderful music.


 How to use the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Module d3m.hsp and sample scripts in the module_sample directory
Is included.

If you include d3m.hsp, you can use the instructions of d3module.

Details of each instruction can be found in hs help d3mhelp.hs. This file
In the hsphelp directory under the HSP installation directory
Help will be available from the Help Manager.

If this is your first time using it, take a look at the sample scripts in order.
In the form of gradually raising the level from a simple sample, for new orders
Since the usage is explained in detail, you can master the basic usage in a short time.
I think it will be.

More detailed information can be found on the distribution page.

For modification of d3module and publication of programs incorporating d3module
There are no restrictions.
