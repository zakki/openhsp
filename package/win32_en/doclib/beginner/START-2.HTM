<h2 class = "play"> step2: Let's use HSP script editor </h2>
<p> First, let's start the HSP script editor. Double-click the "HSP Script Editor" icon to start it. When you start the HSP script editor (HSED3.EXE), <br>
									<br>
<b> HSP Script Editor (untitled) </b> <br>
A window with the title <br> should appear. Yes, this is the HSP script editor ... what exactly is a script ?? <br>
									<br>
A <b> script is a program. </b> <br>
<br> Eh ?? I don't really understand this. In other words, in the world of HSP, the text that describes the order of work is called script. The word program is so widely used that it can be confusing. So, from now on, when you think of a script, think of it as the text used by HSP. Nice to meet you. <br>
<br> What is handled by a tool called paint is image data, the file to be saved is an image file, and if it is a word processor, what is handled is a document, and what is saved is a document file. In the same way, the script editor deals with script files that are saved by the script. <br>
<br> HSP Script Editor is an editor for writing scripts. That said, a script is a text that describes the order of work, which is a tool for writing text. You can think of it as a word processor rag or the "Notepad" that comes with Windows as an accessory. In fact, a large part of it is made to resemble "Notepad" in terms of operations and menus. <br>
<br> The menu bar has "File" and "Edit" menus that you are familiar with in other applications. There are menus such as "cursor" and "HSP" that are rarely seen, but I will explain this later. <br>
<br> Immediately after starting the HSP script editor, you can edit a new script. Therefore, the inside of the window should be pure white. The same situation can be obtained by selecting "New" from the "File" menu. The "Open" and "Save" menus are also used to load and save the edited script in the same way as normal software. However, <br>

<p> HSP scripts have a .HSP extension </p>
								</div>
<p> <br> The Edit and Search menus are no different from most text editors. You can copy, cut, and paste by selecting a range with the mouse or the cursor keys while holding down the shift key. To search or replace, a dialog box for input will appear. Enter the character you want to search for or replace in the text. That is, <br>

<b> HSP Script Editor is just a text editor </b> <br>
It was <br>. As a trial, HSP documentation. For example, even README.TXT can be read and edited. However, the main purpose is to write HSP scripts. Now, let's write a script. </p>
