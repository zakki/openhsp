・ Instruction details


prnflags flag Set printer enumeration flags

flag = printer enumeration flag

Sets the get flag for the printer list that the hspprint plugin enumerates.
The value specified for flag becomes the acquisition flag.
The following flags can be specified. (Multiple can be combined)

Definition name Contents
		----------------------------------------------
PRINTER_ENUM_LOCAL Local printer
PRINTER_ENUM_CONNECTIONS Printers with established connections
PRINTER_ENUM_SHARED Printer with shared attributes enabled

Default setting if flag value is 0 or omitted
(PRINTER_ENUM_LOCAL + PRINTER_ENUM_CONNECTIONS) is used.


enumprn variable Enumerate printers

Variable = variable name to which the resulting string is assigned

Gets the list of connected printer names as a character string.
If multiple printers are recognized, a multi-line string will be assigned.
The number of printers assigned after the instruction is executed is assigned to the system variable stat.
Printer ID0, printer ID1 ... in order from the first line of the list acquired by the enumprn instruction.
The ID number will correspond.


propprn variable 1, variable 2, id, type Get printer information

Variable 1 = variable name to which the value of result X is assigned
Variable 2 = variable name to which the value of result Y is assigned
id = Printer ID (0 ~)
type = Information type to be retrieved

Get information about the printer and assign it to variable 1 and variable 2.
Specify the printer ID with id. The printer ID was obtained by the enumprn instruction.
It will be the one shown by the numerical value of 0,1,2… in order from the list.

The information to be assigned will be the content specified by type (information type).
Select the information type from the following.

Information type Content
		----------------------------------------------
0 Page resolution in Vixel units X, Y
Physical size of one page X, Y (device unit)
2 Distance to printable area X, Y (device unit)
3 Physical page size X, Y (in mm)

If X, Y values are assigned, the variable will be set to an integer type.


execprn id, x, y, sx, sy, bx, by, bsx, bsy, "name" Start printer printing

id = Printer ID (0 ~)
x, y = image position in the print page X, Y coordinates
sx, sy = image size in printed page X, Y
bx, by = Upper left X, Y coordinates of the printed image
bsx, bsy = image size to be printed X, Y
"name" = document name

The image of the current operation window is printed by the printer.
Specify the printer ID with id. The printer ID was obtained by the enumprn instruction.
It will be the one shown by the numerical value of 0,1,2… in order from the list.

The size specified by (bsx, bsy) from the coordinates (bx, by) in the image buffer of HSP
It will be printed. If bx and by are omitted, 0 is used respectively.
If bsx and bsy are omitted, the maximum screen size will be used.

You can specify the position in the printed page with (x, y).
This can be specified on a pixel-by-pixel basis within the page resolution range.
You can also specify the size in that case with (sx, sy).

"name" is the document name displayed in the print queue.
If you omit "name", "hspdoc" is used.


getdefprn variable Get the specified printer

Variable = variable name to which the resulting string is assigned

Gets the default printer name and assigns it to a variable.


prndialog id Opens the printer settings dialog

id = Printer ID (0 ~)

Opens the printer settings dialog.
Specify the printer ID with id. The printer ID was obtained by the enumprn instruction.
It will be the one shown by the numerical value of 0,1,2… in order from the list.
