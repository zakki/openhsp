--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E Introduction

This manual is for HSP script editor (hereinafter referred to as editor) only.
About SDK usage and precautions for developing external tools using HSP3
I will explain.



E Basic usage

Use hsedsdk.as in sdk \\ hsp3 as the source directory or
Copy to the common directory. And on the sauce
Just write #include "hsedsdk.as".
After that, you can use instructions (functions).
See the sample for details.



E Instruction (function) reference

hsed_exist --Check if the editor is running
1 for stat if the editor was running, 0 for not running
It will be substituted.

hsed_getver p1, p2 --Get editor version
Gets the version of the editor of the type specified in p2 and assigns it to p1.
If acquisition fails, substitute -1 for p1 in principle.
However, if HGV_HSPCMPVER is specified in p2, "Error" is assigned.

The values assigned to stat are as follows.
0: Successful acquisition
1: Editor not found
2: I couldn't make a pipe
3: The editor did not return the correct value (including if p2 is incorrect)

The values specified for p2 are as follows. Even with constants starting with HGV_
You can use the numbers in parentheses.
HGV_PUBLICVER (0): Public version (next version at the time of editor release).
First 4 digits major version in hexadecimal, 5th to 6th digits minor version
        7th-8th digit ƒÀ version (0 if not ƒÀ). (Example: Ver1.02b3-> $ 0100203)
You can get each value with hsed_getmajorver (), hsed_getminorver (), hsed_getbetaver ().
You can also convert it to a string with hsed_cnvverstr.
HGV_PRIVATEVER (1): Private version. It has the same format as HGV_PUBLICBER.
HGV_HSPCMPVER (2): The version (character string) obtained by hsc_ver from hspcmp.dll is assigned.
HGV_FOOTYVER (3): The version obtained by GetFootyVer from Footy is substituted.
The value obtained by multiplying the version by 100 is returned. (Example: Ver1.23-> 123)
HGV_FOOTYBETAVER (4): The version obtained by GetFootyBetaVer from Footy is substituted.
The beta version will be substituted as is.
If it is not a beta version, 0 is assigned.

hsed_getwnd p1, p2 (, p3)-Get editor window handle
Gets the window handle of the type of editor specified by p2 and assigns it to p1.
If you specify HGW_EDIT in p2, you need to specify the Football ID in p3.
If the acquisition fails, substitute 0 for p1.

The values assigned to stat are as follows.
0: Successful acquisition
1: Editor not found
2: The editor did not return the correct value (including if p2 is incorrect)

The values specified for p2 are as follows. Even with constants starting with HGW_
You can use the numbers in parentheses.

HGW_CLIENT (1): Client window
HGW_TAB (2): Tab window
