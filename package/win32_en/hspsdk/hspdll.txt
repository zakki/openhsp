Introduction

This text is for plug-in development compatible with Hot Soup Processor ver3.0 or later.
Contains commentary and resources for.
HSP plugins are an advanced way to extend HSP.
It is a means for those who want to use HSP more advanced, so if you do not understand
It doesn't matter if you don't read it.

This text is intended for anyone with knowledge of the C or C ++ language.
Also, if you have knowledge of Windows programming, you can use HSP resources more deeply.
You can use it. Even if you don't understand Windows programming at all
Some programming is possible, such as rewriting the screen only with memory access
is.


HSP extension plug-in regulations

External programs recognized by HSP to extend various resources and functions
It is called "HSP extension plug-in".
HSP extension plug-in is a "DLL program" that calls external files,
A "static library" that calls statically linked ones
It is available from either of.

There are no particular restrictions on creating "HSP extension plug-ins". you,
Whether you make it for personal use or for distribution or sale
You may operate it without the permission of the author of HSP (ONION software).

However, problems and troubles caused by using "HSP extension plug-in"
HSP author (ONION software) cannot take responsibility.

When distributing "HSP extension plug-in", it is an extension plug-in compatible with HSP.
Please specify the fact in the document etc. and get the HSP main body as much as possible,

"HSP TV!"
	http://hsp.tv/

or,

"Hot Soup Processor Page"
	http://www.onionsoft.net/hsp/

I would be grateful if you could specify.

Also, the extension of "HSP extension plug-in DLL" should use either DLL or HPI.
Recommended. The extension HPI is used to distinguish it from a normal DLL and in the Windows settings.
It is for those who want to deal with the case where the extension DLL disappears.

About the sample program

Sample programs, header files for plug-in creation, etc.
It is located in the "hpi3sample" directory.
The included sample source contains some example creations.


What you need for plugin development

When using HSP extension plug-in DLL, Windows 32bit DLL is dynamically
Link For static libraries, link with HSP runtime
You will be able to create a runtime that includes the plug-in.

Windows APIs and libraries can be used for plug-in development without any restrictions.
Any language is acceptable as long as you can create DLLs and libraries.
In this text, basically as a tool for creating DLLs
The explanation is for Microsoft Visual C ++ (6.0 or later).
You can also create DLLs in Borland C ++ or C ++ Builder, but compile and link
You may need to make some modifications for this.


Differences from plug-ins up to Ver2.61

In HSP3, the definition of plugin is slightly different from the previous version.
HSP3 has a function to call an external DLL with an arbitrary argument, and simply call the DLL.
If you just do it, it will be distinguished from extension plugins.
The HSP3 plug-in is a dedicated DLL that works in conjunction with the HSP3 system.
You can access more resources than a regular external DLL call.
The differences between the two are summarized below.

E HSP3 plug-in

Registered by #regcmd and #cmd commands
New instructions / functions and variable types can be created
Access to variable type manipulation and management information
Automatic buffer allocation and event capture are possible

-DLL call

Registered by #uselib and #func instructions
New instructions can be created
Access to variable type manipulation and management information
Automatic buffer allocation and event capture are possible

Operates as an HSP3 plug-in by modifying the source code of the plug-in.
Because you can let it, you can bring out all the functions by all means
We would be grateful if you could release it as a new HSP3 plug-in.


Compatibility with Ver2.61 plug-in

Currently, it supports all plug-in rules of HSP2.5 or later,
Please note that there are some restrictions due to changes in the internal specifications of HSP3.0.

-The BMSCR structure can only refer to the fields from flag to color.
-The PVal structure is compatible with the ver2.5 PVAL2 structure.
-The flag field (type type value) and len field (array information) of the PVal structure
It cannot be rewritten on the DLL side.
-The string type array variable cannot be accessed from the PVal structure.
-The same buffer as refstr is used for the stmp field of the HSPEXINFO structure.

In other respects, the same information as HSP ver2.61 will be passed.
Please note that the following restrictions will occur with HSP2.61 compatible plug-ins.
please.
Also, plugin compatibility guarantees the operation of all HSP 2.x plugins.
It's not a thing.

-When assigning a value to a variable from a plug-in, the buffer is not automatically expanded.
(Be careful not to cause a buffer overflow)


HSP3 system overview

The HSP3 system has a structure in which the execution part of the code is divided into several blocks.
HSP3TypeFunction performs execution and reference for each keyword category (type),
HSP3VarFunction manages data for each type stored in variables.
Each block can be separated arbitrarily and distributed to a plug-in (external DLL)
It is possible.

HSP3 Plugin Overview

HSP3 plugins extend HSP3 system in several ways
can do.
Here, we will explain the outline and method of expansion by dividing it into three methods.

¡ HSP3 DLL Function

You can register new HSP instructions as an external DLL.
Access various system information such as HSP3 parameters and variables.
can.
In most cases, it can be extended in this way.
Items that cannot be extended with HSP3DLL Function include the addition of functions and system variables.
Fine system control such as adding variable types is applicable.
If you want to extend these, HSP3TypeFunction and HSP3VarFunction
Must be extended using.
For details, see "Instruction extension using HSP3DLL Function".
please refer to.
Most of the extension plug-ins included with HSP3 are created in this format.
It has been.

¡ HSP3 Type Function

Extends instructions, system variables, and functions.
One FunctionType is assigned to one HSP3TypeFunction.
Sub IDs from 0 to 0xffffffff are assigned to one HSP3TypeFunction.
You can define keywords.
When HSP is executed, HSP3TypeFunction will be displayed when the registered keyword appears.
It will be called.
HSP3TypeFunction is used at initialization, termination, instruction execution, value reference, and more.
You can set a callback function each time an HSP event occurs.
Inside each callback function, while combining with sub ID information etc.
It must be created to perform the function.
Until HSP2, one function was prepared for each keyword (instruction),
From HSP3, you only need to prepare a function for each HSP3TypeFunction.
Become.
Think of FunctionType as a number to roughly divide the categories.
From the aspect of efficiency, assign different FunctionType to each system variable, function, and instruction.
It is recommended to keep it.
FunctionType is assigned a value from 16 in the order in which the extension plug-in is registered.
increase. FunctionType can be registered up to 8192.

¡ HSP3Var Function

Extends the type to store in a variable.
One VarType is assigned to one HSP3VarFunction.
One HSP3VarFunction is memory management for storing values, various operations,
You need to do type conversion, array management, etc.
Note that VarType is a different value than FunctionType.
The same applies to integers (int), real numbers (double), and character strings (string) provided as standard.
It is made by a mechanism. For the type used as standard, as a sample
The source code is provided.


About instruction extension using HSP3DLL Function

In HSP3.0, as a more convenient means of instruction extension, a function to freely call an external DLL is provided.
I'm waiting. This is for calling WIN32API and HSP2.5 and later plugins.
It plays a role, but also provides other functionality as an extension for HSP3.
It is possible.
DLL calls can be defined and executed as follows.

example:
#uselib "a.dll"; use "a.dll"
#func newfunc newfunc pexinfo; Register newfunc instruction
newfunc 1,2,3; execute new instruction

In the above example, the function exported from "a.dll" as "newfunc"
After registering as a newfunc instruction, it is called.
On the called newfunc function side,

#define EXPORT extern "C" __declspec (dllexport) // For VC ++

	EXPORT BOOL WINAPI newfunc( HSPEXINFO *hei )
	{
		int p1,p2,p3;
p1 = hei-> HspFunc_prm_getdi (0); // Parameter 1: Integer
p2 = hei-> HspFunc_prm_getdi (0); // Parameter 2: Integer
p3 = hei-> HspFunc_prm_getdi (0); // Parameter 3: Integer
		return 0;
	}

You can get the parameters directly and perform any processing in the form of.
This method is the same as the plug-in convention $ 202 in HSP 2.61.
Since all functions and information in the HSPEXINFO structure can be used,
Please consider it as a means to easily add instructions.
However, this method is only provided as a means of extending the instruction.
Finer system control such as adding functions and system variables and adding variable types
If you want to do it, use HSP3TypeFunction and HSP3VarFunction as before.
Needs expansion.


About type ID

HSP3 uses type IDs to distinguish between different types such as numbers and strings
I am doing it.
The IDs used as the type of value stored in the variable are:

#define HSPVAR_FLAG_STR 2 // SJIS string (str)
#define HSPVAR_FLAG_DOUBLE 3 // 64bit real number (double)
#define HSPVAR_FLAG_INT 4 // 32bit integer (int)

Any other value will be treated as an extended VarType.
The parameters and information used by the plug-in use these values as standard.
Can be handled. Also, the above type can be used as the value returned by the plugin function.
Can be specified.
The character string is in C format (8-bit string with end code 0 added) and Japanese is ShiftJIS.
Please note that it is stored in code.

The type ID may indicate the code of HSP3TypeFunction in addition to the type information.
It will be used. (Also known as Function Type)

#define TYPE_INTCMD 8 // Built-in instructions
#define TYPE_EXTCMD 9 // Built-in GUI instruction
#define TYPE_EXTSYSVAR 10 // Built-in GUI system variables
#define TYPE_CMPCMD 11 // Built-in instruction (if / else)
#define TYPE_MODCMD 12 // Module instruction
#define TYPE_INTFUNC 13 // Built-in function
#define TYPE_SYSVAR 14 // Built-in system variables
#define TYPE_PROGCMD 15 // Built-in instruction (program control)

Type ID 16 and later will be the type extended by the plug-in.
These type IDs don't need to be very aware inside the plugin.
Built-in instructions by replacing the built-in type ID or defining keywords
It is possible to replace itself or change the keyword.
In HSP (console mode) for command prompt, the type of built-in GUI is
It will be invalid.


Initialization of HSP3TypeFunction

The HSP3TypeFunction plugin is called by the C function form (stdcall).
When calling as a DLL, write the following preprocessor instructions in the HSP source
please.

#regcmd "initialization function name", "DLL file name", variable type extension number

This will cause the initialization function in the DLL file specified when the HSP runtime starts
Will be called.
The initialization function name must specify the exact name exported from the DLL
It will not be. When exporting from VC ++, "_" is at the beginning and at the end
Since "@ 4" is added, describe the name including it.
(For DLLs created with a compiler other than VC ++, the export name rule is
Varies. For details, refer to the materials for each environment. )
The variable type extension number is a parameter specified when extending the HSP3VarFunction.
If you want to extend only the HSP3TypeFunction, you can either 0 or omit it.
When extending HSP3VarFunction, it is necessary to specify the number to be extended.

In the included sample, it is called "hsp3cmdinit" in "hpi3sample.dll".
The function is registered, but in that case,

example:
		#regcmd "_hsp3cmdinit@4","hpi3sample.dll"

It looks like.
The initialization function receives the following parameters:
(EXPORT macro can be used only in VC ++. In other environments, it is exported separately.
You need to add a specification to do so. )

	EXPORT void WINAPI hsp3cmdinit( HSP3TYPEINFO *info )
	{
// Plugin initialization (register execution / termination processing)
	//
hsp3sdk_init (info); // Initialize SDK (do it first)
info-> cmdfunc = cmdfunc; // Registration of execution function (cmdfunc)
info-> reffunc = reffunc; // Registration of reference function (reffunc)
info-> termfunc = termfunc; // Registration of termination function (termfunc)
	}

In the initialization function, specify the appropriate function for the HSP3TYPEINFO structure provided first.
This will enable the plug-in function.
The HSP3TYPEINFO structure has the following structure.

	typedef struct {
// Information for each type
// (* items are set in the parent application)
		//
short type; // * type type value
short option; // * Option information
HSPCTX * hspctx; // * Pointer to HSP Context structure
HSPEXINFO * hspexinfo; // * Pointer to HSPEXINFO structure

// Function information
		//
int (* cmdfunc) (int); // Command receiving function
void * (* reffunc) (int *, int); // Reference receiving function
int (* termfunc) (int); // End receiving function

// Event callback function
		//
int (* msgfunc) (int, int, int); // Window message callback
int (* eventfunc) (int, int, int, void *); // HSP event callback

	} HSP3TYPEINFO;

hsp3sdk_init has a function that supports plugin creation
It is included in "hsp3plugin.cpp". When using hsp3plugin.cpp,
Please call it first.
After that, the execution function (cmdfunc), the reference function (reffunc), and the termination function (termfunc)
Substitute for the structure. (If you don't need it, you don't need to substitute it.)
If necessary, you can also register an event callback function (eventfunc) etc.
can. When using the event callback function, specify option separately
need to do it. For more information, see the event callback function.
please refer to.
The term func is a function that is called at the end of the HSP runtime.
Specify. Be sure to release the resources reserved in the plugin at the end.
please.

This completes the initialization.
After that, it is registered when the keyword registered at the time of execution appears.
The function will be called.
Keyword registration is described as follows in the script.

#cmd new keyword sub ID

#cmd must always be written after #regcmd.
Below is an example from the sample.

example:
		#cmd newcmd $000
		#cmd newcmd2 $001
		#cmd newcmd3 $002

In the above example, the keyword "newcmd" is sub-ID0.
The keyword "newcmd2" is sub ID1,
The keyword "newcmd3" is registered as sub ID2.

cmdfunc (command receiving function) has registered keywords of HSP
It is a processing routine when it is executed as an instruction.
The simplest command receiving function looks like this:

	static int cmdfunc( int cmd )
	{
// Execution processing (called when executing an instruction)
		//
code_next (); // Get the following code (required first)

switch (cmd) {// Branch for each subcommand

		case 0x00:								// newcmd
			:
Processing when the sub ID is 0
			:
			break;

		default:
			puterror( HSPERR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION );
		}
		return RUNMODE_RUN;
	}

The sub ID is passed as an argument to cmdfunc.
It is standard to describe the corresponding processing separately by a switch statement etc.
It will be the creation method.
The return value can be selected from the following.

RUNMODE_RUN // Continue execution
RUNMODE_WAIT // wait
RUNMODE_AWAIT // await
RUNMODE_STOP // Stop execution
RUNMODE_END // End execution

In reffunc (reference receiving function), the registered keyword is
Performs processing when it appears as a part of an expression in HSP parameters.
The reference receiving function receives the sub-ID information,
As a result, it should return some value.
In the reference receiving function, either a system variable or a function
You can create it.
A system variable that returns a value determined for each sub ID
Also, the one that gets the parameter in parentheses and returns the result based on it
It can be treated as a function.

The simplest, reference-receiving function looks like this:

static int ref_ival; // Variable area for return value

	static void *reffunc( int *type_res, int cmd )
	{
// System variable execution process (called when referencing a value)
	//
switch (cmd) {// Branch for each subcommand

	case 0x00:					// newcmd

ref_ival = 123; // Set the return value to ival
		break;

	default:
		puterror( HSPERR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION );
	}

* type_res = HSPVAR_FLAG_INT; // Specify the return type as an integer
	return (void *)&ref_ival;
	}

In the above example, sub ID0 (newcmd) is treated as a system variable.
If sub ID0 appears, the value 123 is an integer value (HSPVAR_FLAG_INT)
Returns as.
When processing as a function, it will be as follows.

static int ref_ival; // Variable area for return value

	static void *reffunc( int *type_res, int cmd )
	{
// Function execution process (called when referencing a value)
	//
// Find out if it starts with'('
	//
	if ( *type != TYPE_MARK ) throw HSPERR_INVALID_FUNCPARAM;
	if ( *val != '(' ) throw HSPERR_INVALID_FUNCPARAM;
	code_next();


switch (cmd) {// Branch for each subcommand

	case 0x00:				// newcmd

p1 = code_geti (); // Get integer value (no default)
ref_ival = p1 * 2; // Set the return value to ival
		break;

	default:
		puterror( HSPERR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION );
	}

// Find out if it ends with')'
	//
	if ( *type != TYPE_MARK ) throw HSPERR_INVALID_FUNCPARAM;
	if ( *val != ')' ) throw HSPERR_INVALID_FUNCPARAM;
	code_next();

* type_res = HSPVAR_FLAG_INT; // Specify the return type as an integer
	return (void *)&ref_ival;
	}

The basic flow is the same in the above example.
The difference from system variables is that the next keyword is in "(" parentheses.
The part to check if it is, and the closing parenthesis at the end is ")"
Check if it is. And getting the parameters
By the way. Parameter acquisition method is used for instruction execution processing
It will be exactly the same as the method.


Get parameters

You can get parameters in instructions and functions.
If "hsp3sdk_init" is called, use the following function
You can get the parameters.
If an error occurs, execution will be interrupted at that point.
(In the HSP2 plug-in SDK, error check is performed at the end of parameter acquisition.
I had to do it, but in HSP3 I got an error trap due to an internal exception.
There is no need to check because it is done. )

	int code_getdi( int defval );

Gets an integer value. If the parameter is omitted, defval
Returns as the default value.
If it is a real number (double), get the one converted to an integer.
Other types will result in an error.

	int code_geti( void );

Same as code_getdi, but with no default value.
If the parameter is omitted, an error will occur.

	double code_getdd( double defstr );

Get the real number. If the parameter is omitted, defval
Returns as the default value.
If it is an integer (int), get the one converted to a real number.
Other types will result in an error.

	double code_getd( void );

Same as code_getdd, but with no default value.
If the parameter is omitted, an error will occur.

	char *code_getds( char *defstr );

Gets a pointer to a string. If the parameter is omitted
Returns defstr as the default.
Types other than strings will result in an error.
The pointer obtained here is only until the next parameter is acquired.
Not valid. Another parameter after getting the string
If you get (including not only strings but also integers and real numbers)
Character data will be destroyed, so be sure to save it on the parameter acquisition side.
Please try to.
Also, getting a string can return very long data.
There is, so when copying, limit it to the required length, or
Make sure you have enough memory to fit the string size.

	char *code_gets( void );

Same as code_getds, but with no default value.
If the parameter is omitted, an error will occur.

	unsigned short *code_getlb( void );

Gets the pointer on the script indicated by the label.
The label obtained here is the jump destination or subroutine call.
It can be treated as a target.
If a label other than the label is specified, an error will occur.

	APTR code_getva( PVal **pval );

The PVal pointer of the variable specified as a parameter and the APTR
Get a pointer.
If a variable other than a variable is specified, an error will occur.
The APTR pointer is the value of the array element,
The PVal pointer points to the information in which the variable information is stored.
It becomes a pointer.
You can check the type of the obtained variable with PVal-> flag.
Use code_setv to assign to the retrieved variable.

	void code_setva( PVal *pval, APTR aptr, int type, void *ptr );

Assign values to variables based on APTR and PVal pointers.
The type of the value to be assigned to type (HSPVAR_FLAG_ *) is stored in ptr.
Specify the pointer.
If the type stored in the variable is different from the type to be assigned,
It is initialized to the type to be assigned and then assigned.

	int code_getprm( void );

Get one parameter.
The parameter type does not matter. By the return value of this function,
You can check the situation. The return value will be one of the following:

#define PARAM_OK 0 // Obtained normally
#define PARAM_SPLIT -1 // Obtained normally (*)
#define PARAM_END -2 // It was the end of the sentence
#define PARAM_DEFAULT -3 // Omitted
#define PARAM_ENDSPLIT -4 //')'

(*) PARAM_SPLIT has the same meaning as PARAM_OK, but the next parameter to take is
Indicates PARAM_ENDSPLIT (end of parentheses).
PARAM_SPLIT is not the case when you get the parameters in parentheses
Will not be returned. Also, the last parameter is the default value (PARAM_DEFAULT)
In the case of, when the following parameters are acquired, PARAM_SPLIT is not returned.
Please note that PARAM_ENDSPLIT will come.

If PARAM_OK and PARAM_SPLIT are returned, the variable mpval is the parameter
It is created as a variable that indicates the content.
(For any other return value, mpval is disabled.)
Actually, "mpval-> pt" is a pointer where the value of the parameter is stored,
"Mpval-> flag" is the parameter type (HSPVAR_FLAG_ *).
(Even if a variable is specified as a parameter, mpval will take the variable itself
It does not serve as a pointer. mpval is always temporary with the resulting value assigned
It becomes a variable of)

If PARAM_DEFAULT is returned, it means that the parameter has been omitted.
indicate.
If there are no parameters to get, PARAM_END or PARAM_ENDSPLIT
I will return. PARAM_ENDSPLIT indicates that the parameters in parentheses have ended
It will be the value shown.

	void *code_getv( void );

It is a function for calling the $ 202 convention that is compatible with ver2.61 prepared in HSPEXINFO.
The $ 202 convention call uses the mpval pointer to get the PVal pointer.
Refer to. The code_getv function was obtained by updating the mpval pointer
Indicates a pointer to a variable.

	void code_next( void );

Get the following intermediate code.
The acquired parameters are reflected in * type and * val.
* type is the value of "TYPE_ *", and * val is the value indicating the content.
This instruction usually does not need to be used for parameter acquisition.
Only in special situations where the intermediate code is read and processed independently
Please use.

The parameter acquisition method is the $ 202 type adopted in the SDK of HSP2.6.
Compatible with the HSPEXINFO structure used.
Similarly, HSP3 uses the HSPEXINFO structure, and the contents are as follows.
It has become.

	typedef struct HSPEXINFO
	{

	} HSPEXINFO;

Some fields have been extended or removed from HSP2.6,
The contents are similar in many respects such as getting parameters.
The HSPEXINFO structure is defined in hsp3plugin.h with the name exinfo.
Even if you write like "exinfo-> HspFunc_prm_geti ();" in the plugin
No problem. The function (code_geti) described in this section is applicable from exinfo.
It's just a macro to call a function.
When porting the plug-in for HSP2.6 created in the past for 3.0, this point should be considered.
If you keep this in mind, the work will be reduced to some extent.


Acquisition and setting of internal information

The following functions can be used to access the resources on the HSP side.

	void *getbmscr( int wid );

Returns the window ID information specified by wid.
If you are using the standard HSP3 GUI, this is a pointer to a BMSCR structure.
For more information on the BMSCR structure, see the separate section.
Also, the current operation destination window ID is obtained by the active_window macro.
can do.

	int getobj( int wid, int id, void *inf );

The number specified by id, which is located in the window ID specified by wid
Get object information.
The retrieved data is copied to the pointer specified by inf.
If you are using the standard HSP3 GUI, inf contains the contents of the HSPOBJINFO structure.
It will be copied.
For the HSPOBJINFO structure, refer to the item about object information.
please.
The return value will be 0 if successful, and any other value will indicate an error.

	int setobj( int wid, int id, void *inf );

The number specified by id, which is located in the window ID specified by wid
Set the object information.
It is copied to the internal data from the pointer specified by inf.
If you are using the standard HSP3 GUI, inf contains the contents of the HSPOBJINFO structure.
It will be copied.
For the HSPOBJINFO structure, refer to the item about object information.
please.
The return value will be 0 if successful, and any other value will indicate an error.

	int addobj( int wid );

A new object ID is generated and returned to the window ID specified by wid.
It is used when the plug-in side creates its own object.
When you generate an object ID with this function, be sure to set the correct information with setobj.
Please try to.

	HspVarProc *HspFunc_getproc( int type );

HspVarProc structure for processing the type specified by type (HSPVAR_FLAG_ *)
Returns a pointer.

	HspVarProc *seekproc( char *name );

Returns an HspVarProc structure pointer to handle the type specified by name.
name is a character string of the type name (int, str, double, etc.) set for each type.
Specify. As a result, processing including types extended by plug-ins etc. can be performed.
You can get and set the information to do.

	void *hspmalloc( int size );
	void hspfree( void *ptr );
	char *hspexpand( char *ptr, int size );

hspmalloc and hspfree go through the memory manager managed inside HSP
Allocates and releases memory. (It is used in the same way as malloc / free.)
hspmalloc and hspfree work very fast with a small size (64 bytes)
To do. Also, all memory is automatically released at the end of HSP.
hspexpand reallocates already allocated memory with a larger size.
The contents held up to now will not be changed.

	int code_event( int event, int prm1, int prm2, void *prm3 );

Raises HSP internal events.
For more information, see About HSP events.

	void puterror( HSPERROR err );

Raises an HSP error.
The error code specified for err is defined in hsp3plugin.h.
Please note that this function will not come back after being executed.

	IRQDAT *addirq( void );

Add an interrupt factor.
Unique interrupts for Windows window messages, similar to oncmd
You can add it.

	void registvar( int flag, HSPVAR_COREFUNC func );

Register the storage core function (HspVarProc).
For flag, specify the existing type ID or new ID (-1).
Pass the address of the initialization function (HSPVAR_COREFUNC) to func.
The storage core function must be registered when the HSP3TypeFunction is initialized.
You have to do it.

	void (*HspFunc_dim)( PVal *pval, int flag, int len0, int len1, int len2, int len3, int len4 );

Initializes the variable specified by pval with the specified array element.
The operation is the same as the dim instruction.
len1 to len4 are the maximum number for each dimension. The unused dimension is 0.
len0 specifies the initial size when one element has a variable size.
(It is a numerical value corresponding to 256 of "sdim a, 256".)
Specify the type to be initialized with flag.

	void (*HspFunc_array)( PVal *pval, int offset );

Used to create a pval that points to the specified array element.
The elements of each dimension can be set arbitrarily by the following procedure.

HspVarCoreReset (pval); // Reset array pointer
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 1st dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 2nd dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 3rd dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 4th dimension

Pval created by HspFunc_array becomes an array element in pval-> offset
The offset value (APTR) for access is set.

	void (*HspFunc_redim)( PVal *pval, int lenid, int len );

Expands the array of specified variables.
Expands the pval variable to the size of len for the specified number of dimensions lenid (1-4).

	char *(*HspFunc_varname)( int id );

Gets the variable name of the specified ID.
The ID starts from 0 and the maximum number of variable IDs (max_val member of the HSPHED structure) is valid.
This function is only available if the HSP object contains variable name information
You can get it. Otherwise, "" "is always returned.
(Variable name information can be set by the #cmpopt command.)

	int (*HspFunc_seekvar)( const char *name );

Gets the variable ID with the specified variable name.
IDs start at 0 and have the maximum number of variable IDs (max_val members of the HSPHED structure).
If no such variable name is found, -1 is returned.
This function is only available if the HSP object contains variable name information
You can get it. Otherwise, -1 is always returned.
(Variable name information can be set by the #cmpopt command.)


About BMSCR structure

The BMSCR structure contains all the information about the window.
From window size, HWND handle, device context information, etc.
You can get most of the information about windows.

The BMSCR structure is the same as the structure of the same name used in the SDK up to HSP 2.61.
It is compatible in many parts.
The program that operates by referring to the BMSCR structure is the BMSCR structure of HSP3 as it is.
But you can use it. For parts where compatibility cannot be maintained
It has been renamed or the field has been removed.
There are also some items that have been added from HSP3.

The big change from HSP2 is that the field that shows the information of the object
This is where the HSPOBJINFO structure is based.
Be sure to use getobj / setobj for object information.

Write directly to the bitmap screen

The screen bitmap data is stored in the pBit member of the BMSCR structure.
The start address of the memory is stored. Use this to directly display data on the screen
Can be written.

By accessing the memory directly, it is possible to process several times faster than when using GDI.
Will be. Also, since you can freely access the dot unit of the screen, special effects and
It is also very convenient for image conversion.

However, there are some things to keep in mind.

1. 1. The correspondence between the screen and the memory address is upside down.

For some reason, Windows bitmap management goes up from the bottom line.
It has a structure that goes on. Due to this mysterious structure, the upper left corner of the screen has ever been
Those who are accustomed to the structure that goes down from the bottom may suffer.

For example, the screen size is 640x480 and the range (0,0)-(639,479) is in memory.
If so, the first memory indicated by pBit corresponds to the coordinates (lower left) of (0,479).

From there, the address increases in the X direction (right), but proceeds to (639,479).
Next is (0,478). And again, proceed to (639,478), then
It will be (0,477). Dot data are lined up by repeating this until (639,0).
  is.

Dot data depends on the number of screen colors (palmode member).

In full color mode, 1 dot 3 bytes (24 bits) "B, G, R, B, G, R ..."
The brightness of each color is shown in the order of. Also, in the palette mode,
The palette code is shown in 1 dot 1 byte (8 bits).

2. 2. If you write to the memory outside the range of the screen, a general protection fault will occur and it will stop.

The bitmap screen is just a space in memory. Out of range here
Writing data to is a Windows error and HSP exits with a general protection fault.
The range of the screen can be known by the sx and sy members. From the range based on this
Please be careful not to come out.

The address indicating any point X, Y on the screen can be calculated by the following formula.

(In palette mode (256 colors))

x = X coordinates;
y = Y coordinate;
	      width = (sx+3)&~3;
	      vram_adr = pBit + ( ( sy - 1 - y ) * width ) + x;

(In full color mode (16.7 million colors))

x = X coordinates;
y = Y coordinate;
	      width = ((sx*3)+3)&~3;
	      vram_adr = pBit + ( ( sy - 1 - y ) * width ) + ( x * 3 );

3. 3. After rewriting the bitmap, you need to update the actual screen

This is also true when drawing with GDI functions using the hdc member.
As you can tell, even if you draw on a bitmap in memory, it's actually
No change occurs on the window screen.

The screen on the memory and the window on the actual screen are different. Screen in memory
After updating, copy the contents to the window on the actual screen and update
  Have to.

The easiest way to reflect the changes is to redraw using the HSP redraw instruction.
Is to do. This updates and rewrites the full screen, so it's all about
It is better to update with the redraw command at once after rewriting the screen on the memory
It's efficient. This method is also fast enough compared to GDI.

Another way is to use the hwnd member with the GetDC instruction to the actual window.
Get the device context and update it yourself.

For this method, please refer to the functions supported by "HSP Support Routines".
It is relatively easy to do by using it.
See the hsp3plugin.cpp source file for more information.


About object information

From HSP3, object information is managed based on the HSPOBJINFO structure.
It was changed to a shape. As a result, only a limited number of windows have been used so far.
Eliminate the restrictions that could not be placed, and another user later such as a plug-in
You can now add new types of objects.
Objects can be used for general purposes as information held by windows.
You can do it. For example, a new shaped button with a plugin
Or placing controls that are not supported by default
It is possible.
The HSPOBJINFO structure has the following contents.

	typedef struct HSPOBJINFO
	{
		//		Object Info (3.0)
		//
short owmode; // object mode
short option; // object option (unused / internal object is 0)
void * bm; // Pointer to the BMSCR structure where the object is located
HWND hCld; // object handle
int owid; // Value of object (general purpose)
int owsize; // Used size of object (general purpose)

HSP3VARSET varset; // Variable information set from object

		//		callback function
		void	(*func_notice)( struct HSPOBJINFO *, int );
		void	(*func_objprm)( struct HSPOBJINFO *, int, void * );
		void	(*func_delete)( struct HSPOBJINFO * );

	} HSPOBJINFO;

The HSPOBJINFO structure can be obtained and set from the plugin.
Details of each field are as follows.

short owmode; // object mode

Stores the mode of the object.
One of the following is stored as a value.

#define HSPOBJ_NONE 0 // Invalid
#define HSPOBJ_TAB_ENABLE 1 // TAB focus can be moved
#define HSPOBJ_TAB_DISABLE 2 // TAB focus cannot be moved
#define HSPOBJ_TAB_SKIP 3 // Skip TAB focus

	void	*bm;

Contains pointers to the placed BMSCR structure.

HWND hCld; // object handle

Contains the window handles of the placed object.

short option; // object option (unused / internal object is 0)
int owid; // Value of object (general purpose)
int owsize; // Used size of object (general purpose)
HSP3VARSET varset; // Variable information set from object

A field that can be used universally in object processing routines.
varset mainly modifies the contents of variables as well as the contents of objects
Used to store case variable information.

	void	(*func_notice)( HSPOBJINFO *, int );
	void	(*func_objprm)( HSPOBJINFO *, int, void * );
	void	(*func_delete)( HSPOBJINFO * );

Stores the object's processing routine as a callback function.
func_delete is a function that is called when an object is destroyed.
Be sure to delete the created object here.
func_notice is called when a window message is notified
It becomes a function. The contents of wParam are passed to the int parameter.
In order to generate func_notice callback, in HSP window
I have to put in a control that sends WM_COMMAND messages
It will not be. Also, as the code that accompanies the WM_COMMAND message,
(MESSAGE_HSPOBJ + object ID) must be set.
func_objprm is when the value is sent directly to the object from the objprm instruction.
Specify the function to process. The argument int has a parameter type (HSPVAR_FLAG_ *)
void * indicates a pointer to a parameter.
By setting the HSPOBJINFO structure with these callback functions
You can freely expand your own objects.


About HSP event

HSP events are for notifying events that occur at runtime inside HSP.
Information can be obtained and replaced for each of several categories
It has become. For example, you can make file input / output compatible with other devices,
Plugin existing behavior such as extending the read format of picload instructions
It is designed to be controlled from.

There are several categories of HSP events, within the plugin's initialization function.
It is possible to specify a callback function when an event occurs.
The following categories are available.

#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_COMMAND 1 // At the time of 1 step execution
#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_HSPIRQ 2 // When an interrupt occurs in HSP
#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_GETKEY 4 // At key check
#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_FILE 8 // When inputting / outputting files
#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_MEDIA 16 // When inputting / outputting media
#define HSPEVENT_ENABLE_PICLOAD 32 // When executing the picload command

To raise an event callback, select the event type
Must be set in the field.
Below is a function called eventfunc with HSPEVENT_ENABLE_GETKEY set
This is an example of registration.

// Set the event type that raises the event callback
	info->option = HSPEVENT_ENABLE_GETKEY;
info-> eventfunc = eventfunc; // Registration of event function (eventfunc)

With this, when an event occurs at the time of key check such as getkey instruction or stick instruction
The event function will be called.
It is possible to specify duplicate categories. However, one step execution
The HSPEVENT_ENABLE_COMMAND category for monitoring is set for all
Since the event will be generated when the instruction is executed, the overall execution speed will be slowed down.
Make sure to use this category for debugging purposes.

The following is for handling the event that occurred from HSPEVENT_ENABLE_GETKEY
This is an example of an event processing function.

	static int eventfunc( int event, int prm1, int prm2, void *prm3 )
	{
// Event processing (called when HSP event occurs)
		//
		switch( event ) {
		case HSPEVENT_GETKEY:
			{
			int *ival;
			ival = (int *)prm3;
			*ival = 123;
			return 1;
			}
		}
		return 0;
	}

In the above example, the result obtained by the getkey instruction is replaced with the value 123.
In this way, in the event processing function, the contents are replaced from the event type,
Or you need to write a series of actions to get.
The event handling function now returns a non-zero value if it replaces the value
please. Just got the contents of the event or did not process it
If so, please return 0. This will ensure proper event handling.
also,
If multiple plugins are trying to get events in the same category
Plugins are processed in the order in which they were registered.
If 0 is returned (not rewritten), events in the same category will be sent.
The event is also passed to another plugin that is getting it.
If a non-zero value is returned, the event ends at that point. After that
No processing is passed to the plugin.

It is also possible to raise HSP events from plugins.

	int code_event( int event, int prm1, int prm2, void *prm3 );

You can pass events directly to HSP with the function of.
This allows you to jump to a specific label, jump to a subroutine,
You can assign to variables, etc.

Library information is managed by indexes from mem_linfo [0] to mem_linfo [??].
is. Actually, the library information is referenced from mem_finfo.

The LIBDAT structure contains information corresponding to #uselib, #usecom, etc.
For each piece of information, the flag member determines the type of information.
The value of flag can be one of the following:

	} PVal;

The first field is fully compatible with HSP2.5 and later PVAL2 structures.
Many features have been enhanced with fields that have been extended since HSP3.0.
All processing related to the PVal structure is done via the storage core function.
Because it does, it is rare to work with each field directly.
Details of each field are as follows.

	short	flag;		// type of val

Contains the type of the variable.
It can be one of the following, or an extended VarType value.

#define HSPVAR_FLAG_STR 2 // SJIS string (str)
#define HSPVAR_FLAG_DOUBLE 3 // 64bit real number (double)
#define HSPVAR_FLAG_INT 4 // 32bit integer (int)

Contains the mode in which the variable was created.
It can be one of the following values:

#define HSPVAR_MODE_NONE -1 // Invalid
#define HSPVAR_MODE_MALLOC 1 // Normally allocated memory
#define HSPVAR_MODE_CLONE 2 // Clone variable

	int	len[5];		// length of array 4byte align (dim)

Contains information about the size of the array.
When dim p1, p2, p3, p4, p1 becomes len [1], p2 becomes len [2],
p3 is the value of len [3] and p4 is the value of len [4].

	int		size;		// size of Val

The size of the entire memory allocated by the variable is stored.

	char	*pt;		// ptr to Val

A pointer to memory where the contents of the actual variable are stored.
Normally, if it is an array variable, it is continuous from the address specified here.
Space is reserved for the array.
Be sure to use some types, such as strings, as they may be different.
Manipulation of the values held by variables is via storage core functions.
Please do it.

	short	autoresize;	// Auto Array Expand Flag
	short	arraycnt;	// Array Set Count
	int		offset;		// Array Data Offset
	int		arraymul;	// Array Multiple Value 
	void	*master;	// Master pointer for data

The above fields are optional on the storage core function side.
You can use it. Mainly stores information about variable length arrays
is.


About storage core function (HspVarProc)


The HspVarProc structure is used to store information for each type stored in variables.
Thing. Corefunc (storage core function) set in this structure

Set the type information when initializing the storage core function
is needed. Based on this information, the internal operation is determined.
Support is set by selecting multiple contents from the following.

HSPVAR_SUPPORT_STORAGE // Fixed length storage support
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_FLEXSTORAGE // Variable length storage support
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_FIXEDARRAY // Array support
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_FLEXARRAY // Variable length array support
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_ARRAYOBJ // Associative array support
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_FLEXSIZE // Variable length of data for each element
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_CLONE // Clone operation
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_USER1 // User flag 1
HSPVAR_SUPPORT_USER2 // User flag 2

When the variable is initialized, the contents are copied to the support field of the PVal structure.
vartype_name is the information to identify the type by name.
Must be set in lowercase letters so that the name does not overlap with other types
You need to be careful.

User data and user flags are stored on the storage core function side.
Flag information that can be used freely.


	PDAT *(*GetPtr)( PVal *pval );

Returns the first pointer that contains the actual data indicated by PVal.
(PDAT * indicates a pointer to the actual data.)
Offset information (PVal-> offset) if array variables are supported
It is necessary to obtain the actual pointer of the data based on it.


void * (* ArrayObjectRead) (PVal * pval, int * mptype); // Specify array elements (associative array / read)
void (* ArrayObject) (PVal * pval); // Specify array elements (associative array / ready to write)
void (* ObjectWrite) (PVal * pval, void * data, int type); // Substitution when HSPVAR_SUPPORT_NOCONVERT is specified
void (* ObjectMethod) (PVal * pval); // Specify method for variable

When the type has associative array support (HSPVAR_SUPPORT_ARRAYOBJ),
Called to specify an array.
The HSP3 core is at the stage of parsing the intermediate code next to the variable name.
Call the function. ArrayObject, ArrayObjectRead function properly intermediate code
You need to parse it and return the value.
ArrayObject is specified as an array when assigning a variable or specifying a variable as a parameter.
Called at times. After checking the array contents with ArrayObject, the system
If an assignment is made, call ObjectWrite.
The ObjectWrite function must assign the appropriate values to the variables according to the array elements.

ArrayObjectRead is called when the contents of a variable are referenced.
At this time, substitute the type type (HSPVAR_FLAG_ *) of the value to be returned into (* mptype), and
Pass the actual pointer of the data as the return value.
If the type type of the value to be returned can be your own type, you can leave (* mptype) as it is.
The parsing of intermediate code is in the HSPEXINFO structure as well as instructions and functions.
It is possible to get the value using a function.
The ObjectMethod function is executed when the method is called by the mcall instruction.
Is to be done. You can provide an execution mechanism that is unique to each type.


	void *(*Cnv)( void *buffer, int flag );

To convert from the type requested by flag to your own type
It becomes a function. What is requested by flag is built-in type
Only with HSPVAR_FLAG_INT, HSPVAR_FLAG_DOUBLE, HSPVAR_FLAG_STR
Otherwise, you can generate an HSPVAR_ERROR_TYPEMISS error.
The buffer is a pointer to the data that has the requested type.
You need to convert this and return it as a return value.
Do not change the contents of the buffer.


	void *(*CnvCustom)( void *buffer, int flag );

To convert from your own type to the type requested by flag
It becomes a function. What is requested by flag is built-in type
Only with HSPVAR_FLAG_INT, HSPVAR_FLAG_DOUBLE, HSPVAR_FLAG_STR
Otherwise, you can generate an HSPVAR_ERROR_TYPEMISS error.
The buffer is a pointer to the data that has the requested type.
You need to convert this and return it as a return value.
Do not change the contents of the buffer.
This function performs a newly created type operation on a built-in type value.
Called for type conversion when trying to do it.


	void (*Copy)( void *in, void *out );

Copy the contents of in to out according to the size of the type.


void (* Alloc) (PVal * pval, PVal * pval2); // Allocate variable memory

Allocate the size required by the pval variable and perform initialization.
If pval2 is NULL, it will be new data.
If pval2 is specified, inherit the contents of pval2 and reallocate.
Indicates to do. In this case, based on the size and pt of pval2
Be sure to copy the contents. Also, release pt at the same time
You have to do it.

example:
		if ( pval2 != NULL ) {
			memcpy( pt, pval->pt, pval->size );
			free( pval->pt );
		}


void (* Free) (PVal * pval); // Free variable memory

Frees the memory allocated by pval.
In most cases, the HSP3 core will make the call automatically.


int (* GetSize) (void * pdat); // Returns the memory size used by the element (because of variable length)

Returns the size (in bytes) of the content indicated by pdat.
This function is used when the data size of one element is variable length (basesize is -1).
Will be called. Normally, set the same size as basesize back
Please.


	void *(*GetBlockSize)( PVal *pval, PDAT *pdat, int *size );

Returns a pointer and size of the variable buffer (binary).
If the element has a variable length, only the corresponding one array of binaries will be targeted.
If the element has a fixed length (int, double, etc.), it returns a full array binary.
It also returns the memory allocation size in (* size).


	void (*AllocBlock)( PVal *pval, PDAT *pdat, int size );

Reserve a block of memory for binary data.
When forcibly securing the block size when the element has a variable length (str etc.)
will be used. Normally, you don't have to do anything for a fixed length.

About HSP header information

The HSPHED structure is a collection of information contained in HSP file objects.
It can be referenced from hsphed in the HSPCTX structure.
The HSPHED structure is defined in hsp3struct.h as follows:

	typedef struct HSPHED
	{
	//		HSP3.0 header structure
	//

	char	h1;					// magic code1
	char	h2;					// magic code2
	char	h3;					// magic code3
	char	h4;					// magic code4
	int		version;			// version number info
	int		max_val;			// max count of VAL Object
	int		allsize;			// total file size

	int		pt_cs;				// ptr to Code Segment
	int		max_cs;				// size of CS
	int		pt_ds;				// ptr to Data Segment
	int		max_ds;				// size of DS

	int		pt_ot;				// ptr to Object Temp
	int		max_ot;				// size of OT
	int		pt_dinfo;			// ptr to Debug Info
	int		max_dinfo;			// size of DI

	int		pt_linfo;			// ptr to LibInfo(2.3)
	int		max_linfo;			// size of LibInfo(2.3)
	int		pt_finfo;			// ptr to FuncInfo(2.3)
	int		max_finfo;			// size of FuncInfo(2.3)

	int		pt_minfo;			// ptr to ModInfo(2.5)
	int		max_minfo;			// size of ModInfo(2.5)
	int		pt_finfo2;			// ptr to FuncInfo2(2.5)
	int		max_finfo2;			// size of FuncInfo2(2.5)

	int		pt_hpidat;			// ptr to HPIDAT(3.0)
	int		max_hpi;			// size of HPIDAT(3.0)
	int		bootoption;			// bootup options
	int		runtime;			// ptr to runtime name

	} HSPHED;


Get and set array variables

The array element is also fetched at the same time by code_getva which gets the variable name.
Basically, the variable name is a PVal pointer, and the array element is an APTR value.
Will be acquired.
An APTR value of 0 indicates that no array element has been specified.
APTR shows the index of the array element.
The upper limit is the maximum index value after converting all dimensions to one dimension.
If it is a one-dimensional array, APTR 0,1,2 ... is the same as the array element.
There is no problem thinking.

The APTR obtained by code_getva is range checked, so
In normal use, it is not necessary to check the range on the plug-in side.

If you want to set array elements arbitrarily on the plug-in side,
Use the HspFunc_array function.

It is possible to specify elements in the following form.
(APTR value = pval-> offset value)

HspVarCoreReset (pval); // Reset array pointer
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 1st dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 2nd dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 3rd dimension
HspFunc_array (pval, 0); // 4th dimension

You can also extend the array with the HspFunc_redim function.

		void (*HspFunc_redim)( PVal *pval, int lenid, int len );

This function expands the array of specified variables.
Expands the pval variable to the size of len for the specified number of dimensions lenid (1-4).


Notes on code_getprm

In the code_getprm function to get indefinite type parameters,
This is done via the mpval variable, which provides temporary parameter storage.
mpval is a PVal pointer for the variable specified in the script
Please note that it is different from (PVal pointer obtained by code_getva).
Also, since the mpval pointer is managed by the system, you can modify the value or
Avoid processing that changes the contents of the structure, such as changing the type.


Precautions when creating a function

If you have a long loop inside a DLL function, you can do Windows-wide tasks.
Please try to return as soon as possible as it will rob you.
This is the same as the notes about HSP tasks.
HSP itself is running single thread, but on the plugin side
It is also possible to operate with multiple threads. Even in that case, on the HSP side
Be careful not to rewrite the value during execution.
